gb is a Nintendo Game Boy emulator that I wrote because I felt like it. (Also
because I had never written an emulator before.)

Current state:
- No audio (completely unimplemented).
- Input and B&W display works, but many features are unimplemented. Super Mario
  Land is playable.
- Serial "works" (it writes to the terminal).
- Probably lots of bugs.

Building:
- Install Xcode (or some other variant of GCC).
- Install GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/).
- Run `make`.

Running:
- Run `./gb --opengl-scale=<scale> <rom_file_name>`. Choose <scale>
  appropriately for your screen size - the display size will be
  (160x144) * scale.

Key bindings:
- D-pad (up/down/left/right) -> arrow keys
- A -> space
- B -> tab
- Select -> z
- Start -> enter
- (pause/resume emulation) -> escape
- (exit) -> e
